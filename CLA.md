# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the projects (“Projects”) in [mocktomata].

We need you to sign a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") because the project is licensed (typically either [Fair Software License] or [MIT]).
A CLA enables Unison Ventures LLC ("us") to copyleft the same freedom provided by the license.

Here are some key terms in the "CLA":

- Grant of Copyright License. You give "us" permission to use your copyrighted work in our products.
- Grant of Patent License. If your contributed work uses a patent, you give "us" a license to use that patent in our products.\
  You also agree that you have permission to grant this license.
- No Warranty or Support Obligations. By making a contribution, you are not obligating yourself to provide support for the contribution,\
  and you are not taking on any warranty obligations or providing any assurances about how it will perform.

Note that this is a quick summary. You should carefully review all the terms of the [actual CLA][CLA] before agreeing.

## The actual Contributor License Agreement

This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is agreed to by
the signing party ("You"), and conveys certain license rights to
Unison Ventures LLC ("Us") for Your contributions to
the mocktomata projects ("Project" or "Projects").

1. Definitions.

  "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
  authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
  with Us. For legal entities, the entity making a
  Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
  by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
  be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
  "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

  "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
  including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
  is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion
  in, or documentation of, any of the projects and products owned or
  managed by Us (the "Work").

  "Submit" is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing
  code or other content to any Project, including but not limited to
  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
  issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for
  the purpose of discussing and improving that Project, but excluding
  communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing
  by You as “Not a Contribution.”

  “Submission” means the Contribution and any other copyrightable material
  Submitted by You, including any associated comments and documentation.

2. Your Contribution.

  You must agree to the terms of this Agreement before making a Contribution
  to any Project. This Agreement covers any and all Contribution that You,
  now or in the future (except as described in Section 4 below),
  made to any Project.

3. Originality of Work.

  You represent that each of Your Contribution is entirely Your original work.
  Should any materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them
  separately to the Project if You (a) retain all copyright and license
  information that was in the materials as You received them, (b) in the
  description accompanying Your Submission, include the phrase “Submission
  containing materials of a third party:” followed by the names of the third
  party and any licenses, patents, trademarks, or other restrictions of which
  You are aware,and (c) follow any other instructions in the Project’s written
  guidelines concerning Submissions.

4. Your Employer.

  References to “employer” in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone
  else for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g. as a contractor,
  vendor, or agent. If Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for
  an employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your
  Submission by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your
  employer to make the Submission before signing this Agreement. In that case,
  the term “You” in this Agreement will refer to You and the employer
  collectively. If You change employers in the future and desire to Submit
  additional Submissions for the new employer, then You agree to sign a new
  Agreement and secure permission from the new employer before Submitting
  those Submissions.

5. Copyright License.

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
  Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
  reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

7. Patent License.

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
  Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
  section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
  and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
  patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work
  to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent
  litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or
  counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to
  which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
  infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
  Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
  litigation is filed.


8. Moral Rights.
  To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you hereby waive, and
  agree not to assert, all of your “moral rights” in or relating to your
  Contributions for the benefit of Us, its assigns, and their respective direct
  and indirect sublicensees.

9. Other Rights Reserved.

  Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.
  No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation,
  any implied licenses) are granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel
  or otherwise.

10. Representations.

  You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. You
  represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work (except
  as You may have disclosed under Section 3). You represent that You have
  secured permission from Your employer to make the Submission in cases where
  Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for Your employer or Your
  employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or
  applicable law. If You are signing this Agreement on behalf of Your employer,
  You represent and warrant that You have the necessary authority to bind the
  listed employer to the obligations contained in this Agreement.

  extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free,
