# Licenses

This folder contains all licenses used within [mocktomata].

Each project should include the license with its repository.
The licenses in this folder are the master copy to be copied to the respective repository.

## Sources

Below are links to the source of the licenses.
They should be mostly identical to the copies within this folder,
except changes to the needed fields.
But it is also possible that there are difference between them,
as the source licenses are updated over the years.

In any case, the links provide a quick reference to the source,
so we can quickly compare them.
